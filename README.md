# PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT

The **PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT** is designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It ensures that all systems, applications, and processes run efficiently under various workloads.

## Key Features

- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) across all agents and systems.
- **Load Testing**: Simulates heavy workloads to evaluate system robustness and scalability.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights to enhance performance based on collected data.
- **Alerting and Reporting**: Sends alerts for performance anomalies and generates detailed reports.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Identifies areas to reduce resource usage without compromising performance.

## Getting Started

To set up the Performance Agent:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Clone the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Set Repository Secrets**:
   - Navigate to your forked repository's `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Add required secrets, such as `PERFORMANCE_API_KEY` or other monitoring tool credentials.
3. **Enable GitHub Actions**:
   - Ensure that GitHub Actions is enabled to automate performance monitoring and reporting.
4. **Run Performance Tests**:
   - Use the agent to run predefined or custom load tests. Example:
     ```bash
     python src/performance_test.py --config config/performance_config.yml
     ```
   - Review logs and reports generated by the agent.
5. **Review Recommendations**:
   - Access optimization suggestions in the generated reports to make informed decisions about system improvements.
