# PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT

## Overview

The **PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT** is designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It ensures that all systems, applications, and processes run efficiently under various workloads.

## Key Features

- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) across all agents and systems.
- **Load Testing**: Simulates heavy workloads to evaluate system robustness and scalability.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights to enhance performance based on collected data.
- **Alerting and Reporting**: Sends alerts for performance anomalies and generates detailed reports.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Identifies areas to reduce resource usage without compromising performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running scripts.
- **Docker**: Required for containerization and deployment.
- **Access to GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows.

### Local Setup

To set up the `PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT` locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT.git
cd PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT
```

2. **Run Local Setup Script**

```bash
./scripts/local_setup.sh
```
_This script will install necessary dependencies and set up the local environment._

3. **Provision the Agent**

```bash
./scripts/provision_agent.sh
```
_This script configures the agent with default settings for local development._

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the agent to a cloud environment:

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

- Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your GitHub repository.
- Add the required secrets:
   - `CLOUD_API_KEY`
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`
- Any other cloud-specific credentials.

2. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions**

- The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml`.
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflow automatically.

3. **Manual Deployment**

- Use the deployment script for manual deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh
```

- Ensure you have Docker and cloud CLI tools installed and configured on your machine.

## Integration

The `PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT` integrates with other `PR-CYBR` agents to monitor and optimize performance across the ecosystem. It communicates with agents like `PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT`, `PR-CYBR-FRONTEND-AGENT`, and `PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT` to collect performance data and provide optimization recommendations.

## Usage

- **Development**
  - Start the performance monitoring tools:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

  - Configure monitoring parameters in the `config/` directory.

- **Testing**
  - Run performance tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Notion Sync Utilities

The repository includes a light-weight Notion sync framework with aggregated error handling and structured logging.

- **Run the Notion unit tests** (recommended during development):

  ```bash
  make notion-test
  ```

- **Preview a Notion sync without calling the API** by enabling dry-run mode. The environment variable `DRY_RUN=true` prevents handlers from executing and instead logs the intended actions:

  ```bash
  make notion-dry-run
  ```

  You can also call the CLI directly with custom arguments:

  ```bash
  DRY_RUN=true python -m notion_sync.cli --dry-run
  ```

### Manual Workflow Dispatch & Monitoring

- Create and test features on a dedicated branch (for example, `feature/notion-logging-improvements`) to align with the spec-bootstrap workflow before opening a pull request.
- Trigger the `setup-dry-run` GitHub Actions workflow with `workflow_dispatch` to validate integration paths against staging data or sample payloads.
- Monitor initial production runs through the GitHub Actions logs as well as Notionâ€™s activity feed. Repeated failures can be surfaced via optional alerting hooks (e.g., Slack webhooks) configured in follow-up automation.

- **Building for Production**
  - Build the agent for production use:

```bash
python setup.py install
```
