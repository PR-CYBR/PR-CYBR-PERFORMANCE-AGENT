# OPORD-PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Performance and monitoring of cybersecurity systems are essential for timely and effective responses to threats. Enhancements in the way data is presented and interacted with can drive better decision-making.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure the integration of `scripts/setup.sh` to run TMUX for creating interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will primarily focus on enabling interactive data interaction and performance monitoring through the terminal setup.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to trigger the setup script effectively.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to incorporate cloning of repositories and establish TMUX windows.
   - Update `setup.py` to integrate any new package dependencies.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to cover performance-related functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to reflect updated procedures and functionality.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Set up the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message, options, and a progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for monitoring performance.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to observe logs produced by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Output of `ls -l` within the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Keep meticulous records of changes and ensure proper version control.
- Regularly review performance metrics and user feedback after implementation.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Maintain consistent communication through PR-CYBR established channels regarding updates and findings.
- Equip all participating agents with knowledge of the new performance monitoring capabilities.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT to align its operations with strategic objectives of PR-CYBR.**
