# Codex Analysis Summary

This file distills the latest Codex-assisted reasoning for the PR-CYBR Performance Agent.

## Workflow Alignment
- CI runs publish metrics that inform the dashboard module.
- Scheduled audits verify telemetry integrity and surface remediation items.
- Dashboard builds depend on both CI artifacts and audit insights to inform DevX visuals.

## Outstanding Risks
1. Ensure CI artifacts remain accessible to Codex templates under `reports/ci_logs/`.
2. Keep the sync map JSON updated when adding or removing dependencies.
3. Document dashboard deployment credentials alongside GitHub Actions secrets.

## Next Review Window
- Target Date: First business day of each month.
- Review Owners: Performance SRE + DevX representative.
